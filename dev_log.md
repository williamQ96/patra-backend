# Dev Log

## Version 0.3.0 - 2026-03-21

### Context

This milestone turns the earlier PATRA schema-search prototype into a backend workflow that can support agent-assisted dataset substitution. The goal is not only to rank public dataset-backed schemas against a paper-derived query schema, but also to operationalize the next step: materializing only those missing columns that are explicitly marked as derivable with provenance, packaging the result as a synthesized artifact, and routing that artifact into PATRA's existing admin review workflow.

### Problem

- The prior backend implementation stopped at analysis:
  - `paper -> schema -> schema-pool search`
  - `missing-column feasibility`
- There was no safe execution path for Stage A/B/C/D:
  - no transformation-plan generation
  - no deterministic executor
  - no artifact persistence or download
  - no review submission path for newly synthesized dataset-schema pairs
- The PATRA workflow needed a hard boundary between:
  - search-time ranking
  - generation of derivable fields
  - admission into the shared pool

### Philosophy

- Keep the paper-to-schema path code-first and auditable.
- Permit LLM usage only where it improves planning rather than value generation.
- Treat the LLM as a constrained planner, not as a data generator.
- Require code execution and validation before accepting any synthesized column.
- Require PATRA admin review before a generated dataset-schema pair is eligible for shared-pool admission.

### Implementation

- Added PATRA agent-tool request and response contracts in `rest_server/agent_tool_models.py` for:
  - synthesis requests
  - generated artifact summaries
  - validation issue reporting
  - review-submission responses
- Added `rest_server/patra_agent_service.py` to expose:
  - public schema-pool listing
  - paper-to-schema search
  - missing-column feasibility analysis
- Added `rest_server/patra_synthesis_service.py` to implement Stage A/B/C/D:
  - Stage A: optional LLM-assisted transformation-plan generation using local OpenAI-compatible endpoints
  - Stage B: deterministic execution over allowed operations only
  - Stage C: schema/type/shape validation and provenance capture
  - Stage D: artifact materialization to disk for PATRA review and download
- Added `rest_server/routes/agent_tools.py` endpoints for:
  - `GET /agent-tools/schema-pool`
  - `POST /agent-tools/paper-schema-search`
  - `POST /agent-tools/missing-column-analysis`
  - `POST /agent-tools/generate-synthesized-dataset`
  - `GET /agent-tools/generated-artifacts/{artifact_key}`
  - `GET /agent-tools/generated-artifacts/{artifact_key}/download.csv`
  - `GET /agent-tools/generated-artifacts/{artifact_key}/download-schema`
  - `POST /agent-tools/generated-artifacts/{artifact_key}/submit-review`
- Extended datasheet ingest so a review-approved generated artifact can carry a schema directly through `dataset_schema_blob`, without requiring a pre-created schema row.
- Added `generated_dataset_artifacts` persistence and corrected bootstrap ordering so its foreign key to `submission_queue` is created safely.

### How-To Workflow

1. Run `POST /agent-tools/paper-schema-search` with exactly one input source:
   - server document path
   - public document URL
   - pasted schema text
2. Use the returned query schema to run `POST /agent-tools/missing-column-analysis` for a selected public candidate.
3. Only if one or more fields are classified as `derivable with provenance`, call `POST /agent-tools/generate-synthesized-dataset`.
4. Optionally enable LLM planning:
   - the LLM may propose a structured transformation plan
   - the backend still executes the plan deterministically
   - invalid or underspecified LLM plans fall back to deterministic planning
5. Review:
   - generated preview rows
   - validation issues
   - download links for CSV and schema
6. If the artifact should enter PATRA, submit it through `POST /agent-tools/generated-artifacts/{artifact_key}/submit-review`.
7. PATRA admins review the queued submission before the synthesized dataset-schema pair is admitted into the shared datasheet pool.

### Validation

- `python -m compileall rest_server` -> passed
- Local backend + live frontend validation completed against:
  - `wheat_feature_schema.docx`
  - `sugarcane_meteorological`
- Confirmed end-to-end:
  - derivable-field gating
  - LLM-assisted planning with local `qwen/qwen3.5-9b`
  - deterministic execution of monthly aggregation and year extraction
  - artifact download
  - PATRA submission queue handoff for admin review

### Action Points

- Add admin review UI affordances that make generated-artifact provenance easier to inspect before approval.
- Decide whether approved synthesized artifacts should be auto-indexed into the PATRA public schema pool or first pass through a curator-controlled publish step.
- Expand the deterministic executor to cover additional safe transformations such as unit normalization and explicit join-based enrichment.
- Add backend tests around:
  - LLM-plan validation fallbacks
  - artifact persistence
  - approval-time datasheet admission with embedded generated schemas

## Version 0.1.6 - 2026-03-15

### Context

After the live frontend was updated to read from the PostgreSQL-backed backend, model card and datasheet detail pages still failed in practice. The regression surfaced as frontend `not found` pages for detail navigation, and a deeper live validation pass also exposed a backend-only datasheet detail failure when geo-location polygons were stored as null-like values.

### Problem

- The active frontend and backend had drifted on list/detail payload contracts:
  - model-card list responses return `mc_id`, while the older UI expected `id`
  - datasheet list responses return `identifier`, while the older UI expected `id`
- Datasheet detail responses could fail with `500` when `datasheet_geo_locations.polygon` was stored as a JSON stringified null value.
- End-to-end moderation workflows needed to be revalidated after the detail-page repair:
  - asset submission
  - support ticket submission
  - admin approval / resolution

### Engineering Approach

- Leave the frontend-facing backend contract unchanged and harden the backend around the live datasheet edge case instead of introducing a second round of API churn.
- Fix geo-location writes and reads together so newly created rows do not persist invalid null polygons and existing rows remain readable.
- Revalidate the full submission / ticket / admin-review workflow through the actual HTTP/UI surfaces, not just isolated route tests.

### Implementation

- Updated `rest_server/routes/assets.py` so datasheet geo-location inserts now write `NULL` for `polygon` when the payload omits polygon data, instead of serializing Python `None` to the string `"null"`.
- Updated `rest_server/routes/datasheets.py` to normalize `polygon` values defensively on read:
  - `None`
  - empty string
  - string `"null"`
  - JSON strings that decode to non-object values
- Confirmed live moderation flow behavior against the running local stack:
  - `POST /submissions`
  - `PUT /submissions/{id}`
  - `POST /tickets`
  - `PUT /tickets/{id}`
  - final asset publication through approval-time ingest helpers

### Validation

- Local live-stack browser validation completed successfully:
  - asset-link submission queued
  - admin approval created a real model card record
  - support ticket submission succeeded
  - admin resolution persisted and became visible to the submitting user
- Direct API verification confirmed:
  - approved submission stored `created_asset_id`
  - resolved ticket stored `reviewed_by` and `admin_response`
  - `GET /datasheet/{identifier}` returned `200` after the geo-location hardening fix

## Version 0.1.5 - 2026-03-13

### Context

The frontend was successfully connected to live PostgreSQL-backed reads, but the collaboration workflows were still incomplete. `/tickets` and `/submissions` remained unimplemented, so the personalized dashboard, ticket pages, and admin review queue could not operate against the live backend.

### Problem

- End users could submit assets directly to `/v1/assets/*`, but there was no real pending review queue.
- The frontend expected `/tickets` and `/submissions`, but the backend did not expose those routes.
- Admin-only review actions had no server-side surface at all.
- The Tapis account `williamq96` needed to be treated as an admin session in the live workflow.

### Engineering Approach

- Keep the existing asset ingest endpoints as the final publication path.
- Introduce a separate queue layer for moderation: pending submissions live in `submission_queue` until explicitly approved.
- Keep ticketing simple and operational: one table, one list/create/update surface, and admin-only resolution updates.
- Reuse the existing asset-ingest transaction helpers on approval so accepted submissions land in the production catalog through the same code path as direct ingest.

### Implementation

- Added `support_tickets` and `submission_queue` to `db/bootstrap_schema.sql`.
- Added backend actor/admin helpers in `rest_server/deps.py`, with `williamq96` included in the default admin allowlist.
- Added `rest_server/workflow_models.py` for ticket and submission API contracts.
- Added `rest_server/routes/tickets.py` with:
  - `GET /tickets`
  - `POST /tickets`
  - `PUT /tickets/{id}` for admin review/response
- Added `rest_server/routes/submissions.py` with:
  - `GET /submissions`
  - `POST /submissions`
  - `POST /submissions/bulk`
  - `PUT /submissions/{id}` for admin review
- Submission queue rows now store both:
  - display-oriented submission data for the frontend review UI
  - `asset_payload` for final approval-time publication
- Approval of a queued submission now reuses the existing asset-ingest helpers to create the real `model_cards` / `datasheets` records.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/test_workflow_api.py tests/test_asset_ingest_api.py tests/test_database_config.py tests/test_privacy.py -q` -> `36 passed`

## Version 0.1.4 - 2026-03-13

### Context

After the frontend was switched to the PostgreSQL-backed asset ingestion API, the live backend still failed at runtime in Pods. Public read endpoints crashed with `UndefinedTableError` because the connected PostgreSQL database had not been initialized with the expected Patra schema, and frontend-driven asset submissions could not authenticate because the asset ingest API only accepted organization API keys.

### Problem

- `GET /modelcards` failed because relation `model_cards` did not exist.
- `GET /datasheets` failed because relation `datasheets` did not exist.
- The active backend image assumed database migrations had already been run externally.
- The frontend submits assets using a Tapis user session, but `/v1/assets/*` only accepted `X-Asset-Org` plus `X-Asset-Api-Key`.

### Engineering Approach

- Treat schema availability as an application startup responsibility for the active Pods deployment, not as an undocumented manual prerequisite.
- Avoid using the destructive migration file at runtime; bootstrap only the missing schema objects with idempotent `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`.
- Preserve existing organization API-key ingestion for partner integrations while also allowing the first-party frontend to write assets via the same Tapis-token model already used for private asset reads.

### Implementation

- Added `db/bootstrap_schema.sql` with idempotent creation of:
  - `approval_status`
  - `model_cards`, `models`
  - `datasheets`, `publishers`, and all DataCite child tables
  - `users`, `edge_devices`, `experiments`, `raw_images`, `experiment_images`
  - supporting indexes
- Updated `rest_server/database.py` so `init_pool()` now calls `ensure_schema()` immediately after the asyncpg pool is created.
- Updated `rest_server/Dockerfile` to copy the `db/` directory into the container image so the bootstrap SQL is available at runtime.
- Updated `rest_server/deps.py` so `/v1/assets/*` accepts a non-empty `X-Tapis-Token` as a first-party ingest principal (`organization="tapis"`), while keeping the existing API-key path intact for external organizations.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/test_database_config.py -q` -> `3 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_asset_ingest_api.py -q` -> `7 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_privacy.py -q` -> `23 passed`

## Version 0.1.3 - 2026-03-12

### Context

After the initial Pods TLS workaround shipped, a new runtime failure appeared during PostgreSQL pool initialization. The error changed from handshake reset behavior to `ConnectionDoesNotExistError: connection was closed in the middle of operation`, which warranted a direct reproduction against the live database endpoint.

### Problem

- The `0.1.2` workaround forced `direct_tls=True` for `.pods.icicleai.tapis.io:443`.
- Direct reproduction showed that this assumption was incorrect for the Patra database endpoint.
- The real working combination for `patradb.pods.icicleai.tapis.io:443` is regular TLS with `sslmode=require`, not `direct_tls=True`.

### Engineering Approach

- Reproduce the exact `asyncpg` connection mode against the live endpoint instead of reasoning from the stack trace alone.
- Treat the runtime behavior as the source of truth and roll back the incorrect transport assumption.
- Keep the safe parts of the earlier fix: rewriting Pods-host DSNs from `5432` to `443`, and extracting `sslmode` into an explicit SSL context.

### Implementation

- Removed the forced `direct_tls=True` behavior from `rest_server/database.py`.
- Kept the Pods-specific port rewrite from `5432` to `443`.
- Kept explicit `sslmode=require` handling with a non-verifying SSL context for the existing deployment model.
- Updated `tests/test_database_config.py` so Pods-host connections are expected to use `direct_tls=False`.

### Diagnosis Summary

The failing backend image was using the wrong transport setting. For the current Patra database endpoint, `asyncpg` succeeds with:

- host `patradb.pods.icicleai.tapis.io`
- port `443`
- `sslmode=require`
- `direct_tls=False`

The previous image forced `direct_tls=True`, which caused the database connection to be closed mid-operation during startup.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/test_database_config.py -q` -> `3 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_privacy.py -q` -> `23 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_asset_ingest_api.py -q` -> `6 passed`

## Version 0.1.2 - 2026-03-12

### Context

After publishing the PostgreSQL-backed backend image, the runtime still failed in Pods during application startup. The process did not fail in request handling code; it failed while initializing the async PostgreSQL pool.

### Problem

- The backend exited during FastAPI startup while connecting to PostgreSQL on the Tapis Pods host.
- The failure surfaced as `ConnectionResetError` inside `uvloop.start_tls`, after repeated retries.
- This indicated the process was reaching the remote endpoint, but the TLS negotiation mode used by `asyncpg` did not match what the Pods-facing PostgreSQL endpoint expected.

### Engineering Approach

- Treat the failure as a transport mismatch rather than a schema or credential issue.
- Preserve the existing PostgreSQL DSN flow, but make the connection builder aware of the Tapis Pods 443 endpoint behavior.
- Add regression tests around connection option construction so the runtime does not silently fall back to the wrong handshake path later.

### Implementation

- Replaced the old DSN helper with `_build_connection_options()` in `rest_server/database.py`.
- For hosts ending with `.pods.icicleai.tapis.io` on port `443`, the backend now sets `direct_tls=True` when creating the asyncpg pool.
- Existing `sslmode=require` handling remains in place, but the connection is now established with direct TLS instead of PostgreSQL SSLRequest upgrade semantics for that Pods endpoint.
- Added `tests/test_database_config.py` to verify:
  - Tapis Pods DSNs are rewritten to port `443`
  - Tapis Pods connections enable `direct_tls=True`
  - non-Pods PostgreSQL hosts continue to use regular TLS behavior

### Diagnosis Summary

The startup failure was caused by using the wrong TLS negotiation mode for the Pods-facing PostgreSQL endpoint. The endpoint was reachable, but it reset the connection during `start_tls`, which is consistent with an endpoint expecting direct TLS instead of a later protocol upgrade.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/test_database_config.py -q` -> `3 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_privacy.py -q` -> `23 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_asset_ingest_api.py -q` -> `6 passed`

## Version 0.1.1 - 2026-03-12

### Context

Version `0.1.1` captures the follow-up operational hardening after the PostgreSQL migration path was established. The main goals were to make the Neo4j suspension explicit at repository entry points, improve Docker runtime diagnostics for the active backend, and document a supported container workflow instead of leaving the suspended legacy compose file as the only visible example.

### Problem

- Neo4j code had been retained in-repo, but several entry points still looked runnable and could mislead future maintenance or deployment work.
- The active FastAPI container did not expose explicit liveness/readiness endpoints, which made it harder to distinguish application failure from orchestration failure.
- The repository did not contain a supported PostgreSQL-based compose file for the active backend, while the only root compose file was tied to the suspended Neo4j stack.

### Engineering Approach

- Preserve legacy code for reference, but label it as suspended exactly where operators and developers encounter it.
- Add health surfaces that let container platforms determine whether the process is alive and whether PostgreSQL is reachable.
- Make the container runtime more platform-friendly by honoring `PORT` and by providing a default health check inside the backend image.
- Add a dedicated PostgreSQL compose file for the active backend instead of mutating the suspended legacy compose file into a dual-purpose artifact.

### Implementation

- Marked Neo4j-oriented files and services as suspended in:
  - `README.md`
  - `docker-compose.yml`
  - `Makefile`
  - `legacy_server/server.py`
  - `mcp_server/main.py`
  - `ingester/neo4j_ingester.py`
  - `reconstructor/mc_reconstructor.py`
- Added `/healthz` and `/readyz` to the active FastAPI app.
- Updated the backend Docker image so it:
  - performs a health check against `/healthz`
  - respects `${PORT}` for managed container platforms
- Added a supported PostgreSQL-based compose file at `docker-compose.backend.yml`.

### Run Commands

Local Python run:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://patra:patra-dev-password@localhost:5432/patra"
$env:PATRA_ASSET_INGEST_KEYS_JSON='{"org-a":"change-me"}'
python -m uvicorn rest_server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --proxy-headers
```

Docker Compose run:

```powershell
docker compose -f docker-compose.backend.yml up --build
```

Docker Compose stop:

```powershell
docker compose -f docker-compose.backend.yml down
```

### Docker Compose File

The supported active-backend compose file is committed as `docker-compose.backend.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    container_name: patra-postgres
    restart: unless-stopped

      timeout: 5s
      start_period: 15s
      retries: 3

volumes:
  patra_postgres_data:
```

### Diagnosis Summary

The backend codebase did not contain any timer-driven or explicit self-termination logic. The stronger operational suspicion was orchestration behavior rather than application exit, especially for environments that enforce idle or time-based shutdown policies. Health endpoints and image-level health checks were added to make future diagnosis observable instead of inferential.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/test_privacy.py -q` -> `23 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_asset_ingest_api.py -q` -> `6 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_mcp_server.py -q` -> `31 passed`

## Version 0.1.0 - 2026-03-12

### Context

Patra's active backend path is now `rest_server/` with FastAPI and PostgreSQL. The Neo4j-backed Flask, MCP, ingester, and reconstructor code remains in-repo for archive/reference compatibility, but it is suspended and is no longer the supported runtime or integration surface.

### Problem

The backend had drifted from the frontend and from the current deployment model in two important ways:

- The active API surface did not fully cover frontend usage patterns such as protected asset retrieval behaviors and direct asset ingestion for external organizations.
- Repository-level docs and operational entry points still implied Neo4j was an active backend path, which no longer matched the system architecture.

### Engineering Approach

The implementation followed four principles:

- Treat PostgreSQL as the system of record and avoid reintroducing graph-backed runtime dependencies.
- Add direct ingestion APIs for partner organizations so assets can be injected without going through the frontend.
- Make authorization explicit and narrow for write operations, with configuration-driven credentials and bounded request shapes.
- Normalize client-visible behavior for unauthorized or nonexistent assets so the backend does not leak existence information.

### Design Decisions

- Added protected asset ingestion endpoints under `/v1/assets` instead of extending public read APIs. This keeps external write access isolated and easier to secure.
- Used per-organization API keys from `PATRA_ASSET_INGEST_KEYS_JSON` with support for either plaintext secrets or `sha256:` digests. Secret comparison uses constant-time checks.
- Rejected unsafe dynamic keys in user-controlled maps such as `model_metrics`, `bias_analysis`, and `xai_analysis` to reduce the risk of injection through dynamic payload content.
- Standardized inaccessible asset reads to the same `404` detail, `assets not avaible or not visible.`, so callers cannot distinguish between missing and unauthorized assets.
- Marked Neo4j-related compose, Make, Flask, MCP, ingester, and reconstructor paths as suspended instead of deleting them, preserving reference value without presenting them as supported runtime paths.

### Implementation

Implemented PostgreSQL-backed asset ingestion APIs for external organizations:

- `POST /v1/assets/model-cards`
- `POST /v1/assets/model-cards/bulk`
- `POST /v1/assets/datasheets`
- `POST /v1/assets/datasheets/bulk`

Supporting changes:

- Added request models and validators for model card and datasheet ingestion payloads.
- Added authentication dependencies for organization-scoped API key access.
- Added duplicate detection and per-item bulk ingest reporting.
- Added model download and deployment read endpoints required by current client behavior.
- Updated privacy-facing read routes so nonexistent and non-visible assets return the same `404` detail.

### Security Considerations

- Asset ingest endpoints fail closed with `503` when credential configuration is absent or invalid.
- Write access requires both organization identity and a valid secret supplied via `X-Asset-Api-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer`.
- Secret matching uses `hmac.compare_digest`.
- Unsafe dynamic keys are rejected at validation time with `422`.
- Bulk ingestion reports item-level failures without exposing internal SQL details to callers.

### Validation

Verified with targeted automated tests:

- `pytest tests/test_asset_ingest_api.py -q` -> `6 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_privacy.py -q` -> `21 passed`
- `pytest tests/test_mcp_server.py -q` -> `31 passed`

### Operational Notes

- New backend work should target `rest_server/` only.
- Neo4j-oriented `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`, `legacy_server/`, and `mcp_server/` are suspended and retained for archive/reference only.
- External organizations can now inject assets directly through the protected `/v1/assets` API without depending on frontend workflows.

### Next Steps

- Publish the new asset ingestion endpoints and auth contract in user-facing API documentation.
- Add finer-grained ingest scopes if different organizations should have different write permissions.
- Continue aligning any remaining frontend-only workflows against the PostgreSQL API surface instead of reviving legacy graph paths.
